### Bug Fixes

* Avoid silently creating client when initializing core ([#4264](https://github.com/wireapp/wire-web-packages/tree/main/packages/core/issues/4264)) ([65a843a](https://github.com/wireapp/wire-web-packages/tree/main/packages/core/commit/65a843a2052dad2543e6cf046aca55ce85cc7c5e))

### BREAKING CHANGES

* if you were relying on account.init() to also create a new client, this behavior now change and will throw an error instead. If you also want to create a device (if it doesn't exist already), you should use the account.login() or account.initClient() methods instead

### BREAKING CHANGES

* To send `lastRead` and `countly` as protobuf message, you now need to provide a `MessageSendingOptions` object as last parameter. 

```js
core.service.conversation.sendLastRead(conversation, timestamp, true);

// Becomes

core.service.converstaion.sendLastRead(conversation, timestamp, {sendAsProtobuf: true});
```

### Features

### Code Refactoring

* Cleanup storage initialization ([#4257](https://github.com/wireapp/wire-web-packages/tree/main/packages/core/issues/4257)) ([cf952c5](https://github.com/wireapp/wire-web-packages/tree/main/packages/core/commit/cf952c5522ccebe2c4e97d7dbb27de447a532032))

### BREAKING CHANGES

* The way custom database are given to the `Account` has changed.
- The constructor signature now changes.
If you were doing

```js
const account = new Account(apiClient, createStoreEngine);
```

Now you need to do 

```js
const account = new Account(apiClient, {createStore: createStoreEngine});
```

- The `login` and `init` function do not take a storage engine parameter anymore. You now need to give a `createStore` function to the constructor in order to give a custom storage engine to the core. 

BEFORE

```js
const account = new Accoun(apiClient);

account.login(data, initClient, clientInfo, database);
```

AFTER

```js
const account = new Accoun(apiClient, {createStore: () => database});

account.login(data, initClient, clientInfo);
```

await response// This will contain the uploaded asset once the upload is done

### BREAKING CHANGES

* **core:** - `MessageBuilder` has been moved from `account.services.conversation.messageBuilder` to an own stateless class.
- All method of the `MessageBuilder` now take a required `from` parameter
- `MessageBuilder` is not uploading files under the hood. Upload must be done in a separate function call

Replace

```
const textPayload = account.service.conversation.messageBuilder.createText(...);
```

With

```
import {MessageBuilder} from '@wireapp/core/lib/conversation/message/MessageBuilder';
//...
const textPayload = MessageBuilder.createText(...);
```

Replace

```
const linkPreview = await account.service.conversation.messageBuilder.createLinkPreview(...);
cons textPayload = account.service.conversation.messageBuilder.createText(...).withLinkPreview([linkPreview]);
```

With

```
cons textPayload = account.service.conversation.messageBuilder
    .createText(...)
    .withLinkPreview([await this.account.service.linkPreview.uploadLinkPreviewImage(newLinkPreview)]);
