 * The value store util allows storing a single value across page navigation.
 * This value will never be stored on the disk, which makes it a good candidate for storing cryptographic key material.
 * There are no guarantees regarding the time the value will stay in memory. Should not be used as a reliable store.
 * Main use case is to pass on a value from a page to another page.
