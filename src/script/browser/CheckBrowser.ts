 * This file gets compiled and injected separately into the auth and root

 * browser) JS.
 * Since we are using `sourceMap` for both development and production, `webpack`
 * wraps this compiled JS onto its code, which can already break in the oldest
 * browsers.
 * For this reason, we have all primitive feature detections in a separate static JS
 * file, `src/page/browser.js`, that doesn't get compiled by webpack.
 * We need to keep this file as TS in the codebase and not merge with the static JS,
 * to have the possibility to use config values and constants
