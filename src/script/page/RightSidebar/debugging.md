## debugging superpowers

- Get familiar with the logs (printing stuff that are already in the logs is a waste of time)
- Use breakpoints to pause execution of your code
- console.log is still valid for special cases (high frequency events: mousemove, scroll, etc)
- always go to the `DebugUtil` it's full of nice little helpers
